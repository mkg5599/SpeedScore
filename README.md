# SpeedScore

Iâ€™m excited to share SpeedScore, a web application designed for speedgolf enthusiasts. As a contributor to this project, I helped build and enhance a platform that allows users to log and track their speedgolf rounds in detail while connecting with a community of like-minded speedgolfers. Developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), SpeedScore integrates powerful APIs like Mapbox and Google Places to deliver a feature-rich experience. I'm working on React Native application alongside the website.

## Features

- **Detailed Round Logging:**  
  I helped implement functionality that enables users to record every aspect of their speedgolf rounds, including hole-by-hole scores and times.

- **Golf Course Management:**  
  Contributed to the development of tools for adding and managing golf courses, complete with speedgolf-specific details.

- **Community Engagement:**  
  Assisted in creating features that allow users to share rounds, follow other speedgolfers, and interact through an engaging activity feed.

- **Buddy Requests:**  
  Worked on the system for sending and accepting buddy requests to help build a strong speedgolf community.

- **Upcoming Enhancements:**  
  Future features I look forward to contributing include:
  - **Live Auditory Tracking:** Real-time round tracking through an auditory interface.
  - **Smart Tracking:** Automatic recording of rounds using advanced tracking technology.
  - **In-App Tournament Registration:** A seamless process for registering and paying for speedgolf tournaments.
  - **League Participation:** Tools for setting up and joining speedgolf leagues.
  - **Match Challenges:** Enabling competitive challenges between speedgolfers.
  - **Integrated Course Booking:** Booking rounds on speedgolf-friendly courses with in-app payment capabilities.

## Development History

SpeedScore was originally developed by Chris Hundhausen using Google Apps in 2017-18. I contributed to evolving this project into a modern MERN stack application, which is also featured in the forthcoming book *Full Stack Web Development from the Ground Up: Principles, Practices, and Technologies*.
